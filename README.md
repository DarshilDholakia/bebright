# BeBright

BeBright is our MVP design entry to the Bright Network Technology Academy's 2022 hackathon.


**BeBright blurb:**

BeBright is a social media web app designed to help bring the spark back to office conversations and give a new, more flexible route to knowledge sharing. It takes inspiration from the networking side of an app like LinkedIn, but helps reduce the formality/effort that users may feel pressured by, through short daily prompted posts which are inspired by BeReal. The idea is to help employees (particularly new joiners) feel comfortable getting engaged in their offices/teams, while taking away some of the pressures of other networking options through flexibility of posts and creating conversation openers.
